This repository showcases a collection of SQL-based Data Analysis Projects built to demonstrate skills in querying, data cleaning, and insight generation using Structured Query Language (SQL).
Each project focuses on exploring real-world datasets and solving analytical problems through complex queries, aggregations, joins, subqueries, and window functions.

Through these projects, Iâ€™ve practiced the end-to-end process of data exploration, transformation, and business analysis, using SQL to extract meaningful insights and answer key data-driven questions.
