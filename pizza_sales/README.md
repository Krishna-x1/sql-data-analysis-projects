🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Project
📖 Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to uncover key business insights such as total orders, revenue trends, and popular pizza types.
The goal was to apply SQL techniques — including joins, aggregations, and subqueries — to transform raw order data into actionable insights that reflect customer behavior and business performance.

👨‍💻 About

Hi, I’m Krishna Singh.
In this project, I imported the Pizza Sales dataset into MySQL Workbench and executed various SQL queries to analyze order patterns, category performance, and sales trends.
This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL for data cleaning, querying, and reporting.

🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is based on Pizza Store Sales and contains detailed information about customer orders, pizza categories, and prices.
It is organized into the following key tables:

orders – stores order IDs, timestamps, and order details

order_details – contains the pizza IDs and quantities for each order

pizza – includes pizza names, sizes, and prices

pizza_types – holds information about pizza categories and ingredients

Together, these tables provide a complete view of sales transactions and allow in-depth analysis of revenue, order trends, and customer preferences.
